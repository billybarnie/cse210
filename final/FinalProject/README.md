I had to change things a lot from my original design. But it gets the personal information from the user and if the user leaves any personal info blank they donâ€™t get approved. And then they can put either the down payment or the trade in for a vehicle and with the trade in the vehicles worth is based on the year. From there they input the vehicle they want and the year and it calculates the dollar amount before insurance and returns it to them. From there they input their credit and their insurance company and the cost before insurance on the vehicle and they have to verify the vehicle they are getting and then input their signature and their annual income and if the credit is above 600 and their income is over or at 25000 they are approved for the vehicle and all files are then saved like the personal information gets saved, the vehicle before insurance gets saved their insurance company and the cost of insurance is saved, and a letter is made for the user to see if they are approved or denied the vehicle. And also the program tells them their cost of the vehicle with insurance so it gives them a real estimated monthly payment.
